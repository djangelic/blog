I say this, because I feel that I am typically pretty biased towards his novels, and I am pretty happy with his books no matter what. Unfortunately, I definitely don't feel that way about <a title=\"Innocence by Dean Koontz\" href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17797381.Innocence\">Innocence</a>. The book started well, and Koontz tried something I had never really seen before, in that he does not describe the main character until the very end of the book. I have not read many books like that, and while it was interesting, the more you read, the more predictable it becomes. The ending felt like he gave up, and just wanted to finish the book as quickly as possible and collect a paycheck. I was pretty disappointed with it. The only thing that I enjoyed was the imagery. This is consistent with all of Dean Koontz's works, in that he is able to paint an extremely detailed world through his use of metaphors. So, if you are a diehard Dean Koontz fan, go pick up the book, and enjoy the ride. If you are not, don't waste your time, and find something better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3605569-djangelic\">View all my reviews</a></p>\n",

Multiple User Support:</strong> The new version of FlightTrack supports multiple users. This is the main reason I bought the new app (more on this in the cons). My girlfriend is a flight attendant as well, and without flightTrack, it would be difficult to track her flights. Our company issued apps only work for our schedules, not others, so this is an invaluable tool. At the beginning of the month I am able to take both of our schedules and program them into our phones and view our schedules separately. This is something that the original FlightTrack did not have. I could put all of our flights in it but it was a jumbled mess. Now I can easily see my flights and her flights.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Easy mass delete:</strong> Another problem I had with the original FlightTrack app was that after the flights were done, removing them from the tracker required me to select each flight individually and then select delete. With a left or right swipe, I can now remove entire itineraries from the tracker (and with an automatic undo option, I can undo it if it was an accidental swipe). This makes for a much easier interface and allows quick cleanup.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1410\"><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Photos0005.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"Photos0005\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/Photos0005-150x150.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0005-150x150-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0005-150x150-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0005-150x150-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0005-150x150-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0005-150x150-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0005-150x150-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></figure></a> <a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Photos0001.jpg\"><figure class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1406\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"Photos0001\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/Photos0001-150x150.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0001-150x150-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0001-150x150-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0001-150x150-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0001-150x150-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0001-150x150-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0001-150x150-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></figure></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Beautiful Layout:</strong> The old app worked great, and was easy to read, but it was not what I would call particularly pretty. The new app looks amazing, with an easy to manage interface, you can quickly get around it, and easily manage it. When they say they built it from the ground up, they weren't kidding. The two apps look nothing alike, and even though the same core functionality is there.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1416\"><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Photos0007.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"Photos0007\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/Photos0007-150x150.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0007-150x150-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0007-150x150-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0007-150x150-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0007-150x150-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0007-150x150-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0007-150x150-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></figure></a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Complete View:</strong> This is a bit silly, but I think its pretty cool. When you load an itinerary into the system it shows you a map with all the points you will be flying on it. As a flight attendant it looks so cool when you load an entire months worth of flights on it, and it makes for a cool Instagram screenshot/post.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1407\"><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Photos0002.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"Photos0002\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/Photos0002-150x150.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0002-150x150-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0002-150x150-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0002-150x150-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0002-150x150-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0002-150x150-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0002-150x150-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></figure></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Ability to share Itineraries from FlightTrack to FlightTrack:</strong> While this does not work cross platform, if you are sharing itineraries from iOS to iOS or Android to Android, you are able to do so using Airdrop or Android beam. I spoke to a representative of Mobiata, and they are hoping for the feature in the future. In the meantime, there is a built in share feature that allows you to send a nicely laid out text version of the itinerary to friends or family through any text sharing options such as email, text, or evernote. Its a handy tool, and I have already used it more than once to get my flights out to my family.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1432\"><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Photos0008.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"Photos0008\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/Photos0008-150x150.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0008-150x150-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0008-150x150-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0008-150x150-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0008-150x150-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0008-150x150-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Photos0008-150x150-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></figure></a></p>\n<h2>Cons</h2>\n<p>\nOk, so on to the negative.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Buy it twice:</strong> If you are like me, you bought the original app, this is pretty annoying. I personally bought it during the Google sales campaign for $.10, so it was practically a steal for me (and it helps explain why they wanted to build it as a separate app, they probably did not make much money with that version). And I suppose I was spoiled. But others that purchased it before or after the sale are out of luck. To get the new app, you need to pay the $4.99. Most companies would have simply updated the old app to the new so that pre-existing customers don't get burned. It comes across a little greedy, and I feel that it tarnishes Mobiata's image. But, to be fair, here are a few things to keep in mind.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A. If you are a new customer to FlightTrack, this does not matter.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">B. The app is well worth the $5. If you are a flight attendant, you are probably not making much money, so it's difficult to justify the expense, but if you are a mobile professional, the $5 is a great deal for what you get. If you are flying so much you need to track them with FlightTrack, this is spare change.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">C. The original FlightTrack app works fine, and the only real reason to buy the upgrade is if you are tracking multiple people's flights. That is the reason I purchased the app. Otherwise, if it was just me, I would have stayed with the original app. They are still updating the app, and as of this post, they had updated the original app on Nov 13, 2013 to support kitkat. They have not abandoned the app, and they have removed it from the store so that you can't accidentally buy the old one. That shows me that they are committed to their clients.</p>\n<p>\nSo again, while it seems a bit unfair to older customers that they have to repurchase the app, keep in mind if you bought it for $.10, you practically got it free, and if you paid full price, ask yourself if you really need the new features.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Connecting flights:</strong> I had trouble finding flights that had connecting flights. For example if I want to fly from ONT to TUS, I would have to know that I need to fly through PHX, it doesn't automatically figure that out for you. Per Mobiata, there are simply too any variables for this feature and they have no way of knowing what flight you are looking for. For now I use their Expedia app to find this information.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>\nFlightTrack 5 is a highly polished tool that is well worth the $5 investment. If you are looking for a way to monitor your flights, and you are like me and practically live in an airplane, it is a great investment. The Pros outweigh the Cons, and every time I show someone the app, they ask me how to get it, and if it's worth the price and I always say ABSOLUTELY. It will make your flights less stressful and enjoyable, and it's one less thing you need to worry about.</p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1420\"><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobiata.flighttrack.five\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"Play-Store-Final\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/Play-Store-Final.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Play-Store-Final-xs.png 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Play-Store-Final-sm.png 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Play-Store-Final-md.png 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Play-Store-Final-lg.png 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Play-Store-Final-xl.png 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/Play-Store-Final-2xl.png 1600w\"  width=\"270\" height=\"91\" /></figure></a></p>\n<figure class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1421\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flighttrack-5/id716913565?mt=8\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  alt=\"App-Store-Final\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/App-Store-Final.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/App-Store-Final-xs.png 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/App-Store-Final-sm.png 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/App-Store-Final-md.png 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/App-Store-Final-lg.png 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/App-Store-Final-xl.png 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/244/responsive/App-Store-Final-2xl.png 1600w\"  width=\"270\" height=\"91\" /></figure></a></p>\n",

            "summary": "<p>When it comes to photo sharing, Facebook is usually the way to go. Unfortunately, not everyone is on Facebook (yeah, crazy right?). Well I have found a great app that is on both Android and iOS that helps bridge that gap. It's called cluster, and in a nutshell, it allows people to create a space to share photos for different events. A great example is going to be coming up in February, I have a skiing trip planned with a group of my close friends. Usually we would have to create a dropbox folder, and if any of my friends don't have a dropbox account they would then need to create one. Normally this isn't bad, but it is complicated, and a bit much for what we need. We just need a place to share photos as a group, and download them all in one go. This is great if you are normally the designated photographer of a group, and are never in photos because you are the one taking them! This way everyone can take photos of everyone and have them in one place! Cluster makes this quick and efficient. Read on for more!</p>\n",

Read on for more!</p>\n\n<p>This is a great tool for:</p>\n<p>Brides/Grooms – Have your DJ announce or post your album code if there is a projector\nFriends – easily gather photos from everyone in your group after a fun night out.\nParents – collect photos of your children and share memories with family everywhere.\nTravelers – create an album of your trip and collect photos from travel friends.\nEvents - I went through flight attendant training, and this would have been great to get everyone's photos together</p>\n<p>The process could not be simpler! Install the app and create an account (or if you have facebook use the Facebook login button). After you have your account created, simply create a new cluster and add photos from your phone, or take someones Album Code and join their cluster. From there just add photos and you are good to go. I have to say, it could not be easier to use, and I plan on using it a lot!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cluster-group-photo-albums/id596595032?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Iphone iOS Store</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getcluster.android&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Android Play Store</a></p>\n\n<p>[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"1386,1387,1388,1389,1390\"]</p>\n",

This was actually not what I expected. I thought  that maybe I would be connecting through Skype or some other program to a live representative and we would be initiating a normal interview that way. It is actually a video recording of you, talking to your webcam (or if you don't have a webcam, they have a call in option that allows you to record your voice), and asking you questions. These questions are very basic, and two of them that stood out to me where \"Why do you want to become a flight attendant\" and \"Why do you think you would make a good flight attendant.\" This was easily the scariest part for me, since I was not able to see the person, and you only really get one try per question. I had a lot of Umm's and Ahhh's in there, and was sure I did not pass at all. Thankfully I did, and I attribute a lot of it to SMILING!! I am a happy person in general, and this helped a lot! I smiled throughout the whole thing. A few days after the video interview, I got an email stating that I had passed the video interview, and I was ready to move on the next part of the interview, the in person group interview.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-1331 \"><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"margin: 5px;\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle-300x159-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"One of the main reasons I want to fly, is to visit castles such as this one\" width=\"300\" height=\"159\" /></figure></a> One of the main reasons I want to fly, is to visit castles such as this one</p>\n<h3>In Person Group Interview</h3>\n<p>\nThis was easily the most fun out of the whole process! They flew me out to Dallas TX to interview with around 30 other applicants. I was given the option to fly out the night before and pay for my own hotel, or fly out the day of. I went the day before, so I would be rested for the interview. When I arrived at the training area, it was  amazing! It is like a giant resort, mostly for their trainees and a few other companies. The trainees live there for two and a half months during training, and it becomes a home away from home. After checking in the front desk, because I was an hour early, I sat down and noticed a few other people waiting, and started up a conversation with them. They were also applicants, and they were just as excited and nervous as I was. After we entered, the process was pretty straightforward. They had different team building exercises and activities to get to know us a bit better and to see how we interacted with each other. My advice to you here is this. SMILE! Smile smile smile! Be happy you are there, and excited! Greet everyone you meet! Try to be a leader in the activities if you can, and show the interviewers that you are confident. At the end of the day, we had our two interviews, a four person panel interview, and a one on one interview. Just remember to be yourself, and again, smile! If you did well, you will be taken separately and fingerprinted in anticipation of the next step, the background check!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/james_i_think_your_covers_blown.jpg\"><figure class=\"alignleft wp-image-1332\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/james_i_think_your_covers_blown-300x199-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Background Check\" width=\"168\" height=\"111\" /></figure></a>The Background Check</h3>\n<p>\nThis part is pretty straight forward. If you passed the group interview, you will be asked to provide a history of your work background, and more information. This will take a few days, and if you pass, you will need to go back to dallas for the next step in the process,  The Drug Exam and Agility Exam.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gettinghugejpg.jpg\"><figure class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1340\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/gettinghugejpg-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/gettinghugejpg-300x200-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/gettinghugejpg-300x200-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/gettinghugejpg-300x200-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/gettinghugejpg-300x200-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/gettinghugejpg-300x200-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/241/responsive/gettinghugejpg-300x200-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"getting-huge.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></figure></a>The Drug Exam and Agility Exam</h3>\n<p>\nThis part should be quite straightforward, you will be required to do a drug exam,  and agility test, although in my case, I was flown out to Dallas to do this as well. I think the drug exam part is pretty straightforward of course (make sure to disclose any medication you are taking, and be prepared to have your doctor send a letter regarding any strong medications you take on a regular basis), but the agility exam could be difficult if you are a smaller woman. You will be required to push a certain amount of weight (they don't tell you exactly how much, but the general consensus is 60 pounds to push, pull, and lift, all the while maintaining a specific heart rate. Thats pretty much the final step. If you pass here, you will be invited to the next part, the Training Process.</p>\n<h3>The Training Process</h3>\n<p>\nIf you have continued to read this, congrats! But here is the tough part. If you make it through all of this, then you will be invited to go to the Flight Attendant training. Please keep in mind, you it is two and half months of unpaid training (room, board, and food will be provided), and from everything I have read, it is not easy training. Make sure you have enough money in the bank to cover your bills during that time.</p>\n<p>I am super excited to start my new adventure as a flight attendant, and I am looking forward to it! The perks are awesome, and being able to see the world is an opportunity I don't want to miss out on. Hope to see you in the air!</p>\n",

This of course, is my opinion, so feel free to disagree, but I find that to be a good friend, a good person, or just a decent human being, you need to give value. What does that mean? \n\n<p>I define being a value giver, first and foremost as someone who you want to be around. Think about your friends, think about their personalities, what about them draws them to you? To me, I want to be around people that strengthen me and make me a better person. I don't want to be around someone who brings me down, who makes my friends feel awkward or who stirs up trouble among them. Naomi says in the <a href=\"http://www.imasocialentrepreneur.com/go-giver-law-value/\">The Go-Giver</a> that</p>\n<blockquote>Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value rather than what you take in payment</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<p>\nSocial value can be defined as many different things. Some examples are:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n\t\n<li>telling funny jokes</li>\n<li>coming up with fun things to do</li>\n<li>being very good-looking or well dressed</li>\n<li>buying or bringing drinks</li>\n<li>introducing new people</li>\n<li>being an awesome wingman (or winggirl)</li>\n<li>pushing people out of their comfort zones</li>\n<li>the ability to get over one's approach anxiety</li>\n<li>being a fun, outgoing person</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the_kindness_of_strangers.jpg\"><figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-1313\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"margin: 8px;\" alt=\"The kindness of strangers\" src=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/responsive/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200-xs.jpg 300w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/responsive/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/responsive/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/responsive/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/responsive/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/240/responsive/the_kindness_of_strangers-300x200-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></figure></a> Help a random stranger today!</p>\n<p>These are all little things that you can do for your friends, that maybe in and of themselves might not cost you much (the key here being that price is not the same thing as value), but they are an investment that you are making in your friends that will pay off on its own. This is not something that you calculate or keep track of, this is something that over time will give back to you automatically. A few other tips to remember when being a social giver:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Be Postive</strong>: We all have dirty laundry, we all go through terrible things. But the internet is not the place to air that laundry. Keep it private and to yourself and your close friends. I have drawn more strength from my best friends than I have ever gotten from a vaguely worded passive aggressive post on Facebook. Don't do it. Things like \"I need a girlfriend/boyfriend\" or \"I hate my life (or certain unnamed others)\" doesn't give you value, as a matter of fact, people read these posts and take away social value when they read them. You might be completely alone and sad, but that doesn't mean anyone else needs to know.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Approach People:</strong> Ok, I know this is a hard one. Some people are not extroverts, and since I am, it is sometimes hard for me to understand why some people have a hard time with this one. But here is the thing, you don't have to approach someone of the opposite sex. Find a passion, and go out and meet people that share them. For me, it was dancing! I love to dance, so I joined a dance class, and made many friends that way! Sit down and find out what makes you happy, and pursue it (and remember passive things like video games don't really count). Pick something active, like rock climbing or hiking and start out small and work your way up. Set aside a day a week to do this, and make sure NOTHING interrupts it.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Help Others</strong>: Another fairly self explanatory one, but again one that people miss. I touched on this at the beginning, but again stop thinking about yourself and your problems and ask yourself what you can do to help other people's problems. Buy a friend lunch, take someone out to the movies (as friends!), invite someone over to play board games, check other people's facebook and see if someone is in need. Only by helping others, can you truly find happiness, and in turn build friendships.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Respect people's beliefs:</strong> Some people may believe differently than you do, and that is ok (to an extent of course). Some times you need to get off your high horse and be humble. Not religious? Don't bash other's religions. Religious? Don't bash or judge others for not being that way. Never feel superior to others because of their beliefs. Take it as a cue to reexamine your beliefs and make you better understand them.</p>\n<p>So those are my thoughts, and that is my life. Want to make friends? Live for others. When you die, you won't regret your life. :)</p>\n</div>\n\n\n",

            "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So today my buddy sent me a link to a new game that he is playing and it cracked me up! If you haven't played Grumpy Bears yet, click on the image below and download it (Android version, iOS version coming soon according to the developer)! Think of the game as a cross between whack a mole, and angry birds, requiring precision and quick reflexes to master.  On top of the fast paced action, there is also the ability to buy weapons upgrades and level yourself up. The crazy bears will have you laughing and the nutty weapons will crack you up. My absolute favorite so far is Thor's hammer, that zaps the stuffing out of any bear that gets to close to the vehicle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The game is very polished and looks like a lot of work went into making it. It runs a little slow on my Galaxy S3 sometimes but that might have more to do with my background apps that I have rather than the game. Otherwise, 98% of the time it runs smooth as silk. If you are bored and want to have a bit of fun, do yourself a favor and check out the game! Screenshots after the break!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
