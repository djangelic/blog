When I was younger, my parents gave me the BBC movies from television of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe_(1967_TV_serial)">The lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>. Me and my siblings later watched all of them, but our love for the series escalated like never before. We read the books, and learned the mythology behind it. It is one of my happiest memories from my childhood. The new movies are definitely alive with the magic of the originals, and the books. Watching the new Narnia movie, I was immediately sucked in, and felt right at home with the characters. They were very believable, and very likable. I even liked Eustace, the brat. It is full of action, and adventure, but also with moral cautions, and spiritual overtones. The special effects were wonderful, and very realistic, but I did have one complaint. The 3D was HORRIBLE! I found myself pushing the glasses up because the glasses dim the light from the screen a lot, and the 3D was very minimal. Most movies make an effort and have 2 or 3 moments that are just in the movie to showcase the 3D, but not this movie. Sure the waves of the ocean seemed real, and there were moments when it was nice, but if I had known it would be that bad, I wouldn't have bothered.<p></p><p><strong>Family Friendliness</strong></p><p>I found the voyage of the dawn treader to have many moments of instilling deep morals, but near the end of the movie, a giant monster appears that destroys any benefit a very young child would get from the dialogue. If the little one is under 8, you might want to refrain from taking them. Of course with all the monsters kids see on TV nowadays, this one is nothing compared to those.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/the-google-chrome-os-cr-48-waiting-game.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The Google Chrome OS Cr-48 Waiting Game</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/book-review-a-storm-of-swords.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Book Review - A Storm of Swords </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-13T17:11" class="feed__date">November 13, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-the-last-airbender.html">Movie Review - The last Airbender</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-12T16:48" class="feed__date">November 12, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-jonah-hex.html">Movie Review - Jonah Hex</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-04T19:57" class="feed__date">November 4, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/kik-messenger-review-chat-like-its-1999.html">Kik Messenger Review - Chat like its 1999...</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
