As a true bookworm, I will always prefer the depth and level of detail present in a book. My mind seems to be much more capable at building a world than most movie directors, and it can be very frustrating watching a badly made book adaptation. More often than not this is the case, with some exceptions (see LOTR trilogy), but I was pleasantly surprised with The Hunger Games. Read on for my full review. <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/quick-movie-review-the-hunger-games.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2012-02-28T09:47" class="feed__date">February 28, 2012</time></div><h2><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/the-no-fast-food-for-a-month-challenge.html">The &quot;No Fast Food For A Month&quot; Challenge...</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>A friend of mine told me about a Reddit posting the other day where the person would only eat home cooked meals for the entire month of March. This got me thinking, and I came up with several conclusions. First, I don't think I have ever done that in my life, so just to say I have done it, this is a great challenge. Secondly, I spend a LOT of money on fast food. And by a lot, I mean I eat out almost every day, since I am always on the road. First of all, as I am sure you know, I can't begin to tell you how unhealthy this is. Not only is this type of food not very good for you, it is also very expensive. On a typical day, I probably spend anywhere between $5-$15. This adds up very quickly and can make a huge dent in your budget. Lastly, I am not a very good cook. At least, I don't think I am. I haven't had to cook much throughout my life, so I think this is a great time to learn. So, how will I accomplish this feat?

I simply cannot control him.” My kindergarten teacher spoke these words as she stormed off, leaving my mother dumbstruck and with a terrible feeling of failure. My constant interruptions in class had finally worn through my teachers nerves, further frustrating her because I was sincerely sorry for my actions and wished to correct them but unable to. I sunk into a feeling of frustration and despair, believing that I was, as was termed by my teachers, “lazy and uncooperative.” I was shortly thereafter referred to a local doctor and then a psychologist for testing. My parents’ worst fear was that I had Bipolar (maniac depression) Disorder. As it turned out, this was not the case. Instead I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

I have noticed a growing trend on Facebook recently, that I like to call "Machine Gun Posting." If I have added you as a friend on Facebook, it means that I genuinely like you. But, if you are going to be posting a new status update every 30 seconds, we need to rethink this whole Facebook friendship thing. So below is a list of things I think make for good Facebook etiquette. Don't like it? Then friend me on Twitter instead.
