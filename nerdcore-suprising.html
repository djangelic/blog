Now, Being a big nerd, I know nothing of sports, so the conversation become a little awkward for a moment. Till I realized something. He is just as big a nerd as I am. Taking a step back, I realize now, that guys will automatically gravitate towards being some kind of nerd. Whether its computers in my case, or Football, or guns, Guys need to become an "expert" in whatever field they find interesting. He started telling me about something called fantasy football. For those of you who don't know, fantasy football is a game that is played with a group of people, each of whom creates a fantasy dream team of football players, taken from real football players. I listened to him in open mouthed amazement! This sounded suspiciously familiar! My mind conjured up thoughts of a group of kids, sitting around a table, and instead of wearing dungeon master hats, and nerd attire, a bunch of guys wearing football jerseys. While Dungeons and Dragons does involve a little more imagination than fantasy football, they are very similar... Both involve a group of guys getting together competing with stats on their "players" and having a good time. This makes me think, nerds and jocks are very much alike, at least deep down inside. They both like to use their imagination, the like to compete, and they like to become very knowledgeable in a subject. It makes me wonder why there is so much animosity between the 2 groups. Deep down inside, the 2 of them are just nerds!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/my-mom.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> My Mom</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/used-vs-new.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Used Vs.
