Secondly, I spend a LOT of money on fast food. And by a lot, I mean I eat out almost every day, since I am always on the road. First of all, as I am sure you know, I can't begin to tell you how unhealthy this is. Not only is this type of food not very good for you, it is also very expensive. On a typical day, I probably spend anywhere between $5-$15. This adds up very quickly and can make a huge dent in your budget. Lastly, I am not a very good cook. At least, I don't think I am.

I will make at least one Crock pot item, that will hopefully last me a week, and in the mornings, I will attempt to wake up a little earlier. I will also do my best to exercise at least every other day, for a minimum of 20 minutes (I want to walk around my neighborhood, I have plotted it out to be at least 2 miles if I do it correctly).<p></p><p>I hope several things happen. First, I hope that I feel generally healthier, and can make this an ongoing trend, only eating out when I absolutely have too. I would like to lose weight, and I think this will help me. Secondly, I hope that I can see a significant amount of money saved in this venture, and take a tighter hold of my budget. Third, I hope that my cooking skills increase. I will be gathering recipes from reddit in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/" target="_blank">/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/</a> section, and while many of them are not all that healthy, I am sure that they are healthier than the crap served at Wal-Mart. Lastly, I hope that I can blog every day for a month. I want to get into the rhythm of blogging daily, and make it a habit to do so. Maybe it will be therapeutic... Anyway, I will post all of these posts at the top of the blog for now, under the Food Diaries. Wish me luck in the comments, and let me know if you have any tips I can follow to make it through the month!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/how-to-get-a-great-deal-on-a-motorcycle-on-craigslist.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How to get a great deal on a motorcycle on Craigslist</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/quick-movie-review-the-hunger-games.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Quick Movie Review - The Hunger Games </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2012-10-30T03:50" class="feed__date">October 30, 2012</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/how-to-make-puerto-rican-food-on-the-cheap.html">How to make Puerto Rican food on the cheap!</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2012-02-10T20:59" class="feed__date">February 10, 2012</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/life-in-the-fast-lane-2.html">Life In The Fast Lane</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-09-27T06:40" class="feed__date">September 27, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/adhd-imagine-life-only-faster.html">ADHD, Imagine life, only faster</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
