What does that mean? </p><p>I define being a value giver, first and foremost as someone who you want to be around. Think about your friends, think about their personalities, what about them draws them to you? To me, I want to be around people that strengthen me and make me a better person. I don't want to be around someone who brings me down, who makes my friends feel awkward or who stirs up trouble among them.

This is not something that you calculate or keep track of, this is something that over time will give back to you automatically. A few other tips to remember when being a social giver:</p><p>1. <strong>Be Postive</strong>: We all have dirty laundry, we all go through terrible things. But the internet is not the place to air that laundry. Keep it private and to yourself and your close friends. I have drawn more strength from my best friends than I have ever gotten from a vaguely worded passive aggressive post on Facebook. Don't do it. Things like "I need a girlfriend/boyfriend" or "I hate my life (or certain unnamed others)" doesn't give you value, as a matter of fact, people read these posts and take away social value when they read them. You might be completely alone and sad, but that doesn't mean anyone else needs to know.</p><p>2. <strong>Approach People:</strong> Ok, I know this is a hard one. Some people are not extroverts, and since I am, it is sometimes hard for me to understand why some people have a hard time with this one. But here is the thing, you don't have to approach someone of the opposite sex. Find a passion, and go out and meet people that share them. For me, it was dancing! I love to dance, so I joined a dance class, and made many friends that way! Sit down and find out what makes you happy, and pursue it (and remember passive things like video games don't really count). Pick something active, like rock climbing or hiking and start out small and work your way up. Set aside a day a week to do this, and make sure NOTHING interrupts it.</p><p>3. <strong>Help Others</strong>: Another fairly self explanatory one, but again one that people miss. I touched on this at the beginning, but again stop thinking about yourself and your problems and ask yourself what you can do to help other people's problems. Buy a friend lunch, take someone out to the movies (as friends!), invite someone over to play board games, check other people's facebook and see if someone is in need. Only by helping others, can you truly find happiness, and in turn build friendships.</p><p>4. <strong>Respect people's beliefs:</strong> Some people may believe differently than you do, and that is ok (to an extent of course). Some times you need to get off your high horse and be humble. Not religious? Don't bash other's religions. Religious? Don't bash or judge others for not being that way. Never feel superior to others because of their beliefs. Take it as a cue to reexamine your beliefs and make you better understand them.</p><p>So those are my thoughts, and that is my life. Want to make friends? Live for others. When you die, you won't regret your life. :)</p></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/log-out.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Log Out</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/my-path-to-flight-attendant.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> My Path To Flight Attendant </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
