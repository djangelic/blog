There is plenty of Sci Fi action and violence, so its not good for the kiddos. But otherwise, it was a trip! It really took you back in time to the 70's!</p><p>The plot deals with a small town that makes a living off the Steel mill. You are introduced to the main character through the death of his mother, who was involved in an accident in the mill. You slowly began to meet all of the characters after that. The characters were well casted, and very believable. As you get to know the characters, you see that they are involved in making a movie for a competition, and are shooting it when they accidentally film a train wreck, and what emerges from the train wreckage is more than they can ever imagine. The movie is very interesting and I highly recommend it :)</p><p>[review pros="Original Plot, Great cinematic, great actors, Good plot" cons="Ending is a little bit cliche" score=92]</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/tech-trends-dawn-of-lifecasting-and-what-it-is.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Tech Trends - Dawn of LifeCasting (And what it is!)</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Movie Review - Rise of the Planet of the Apes </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-04T19:57" class="feed__date">November 4, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/kik-messenger-review-chat-like-its-1999.html">Kik Messenger Review - Chat like its 1999...</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-09-18T20:37" class="feed__date">September 18, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/software-review-ziprealty-android-app.html">Software Review: Ziprealty Android App</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-08-13T00:00" class="feed__date">August 13, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/software-review-osticket-helpdesk-solution.html">Software Review: OsTicket - HelpDesk Solution</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
