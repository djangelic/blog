ADHD is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and about 4% of people in the US have it. Most people think that ADHD is simply someone who is rambunctious and hyper, but that is not the case. ADHD is a neurodisorder,  which affects the neurons in your brain. Your brain is a complicated electrical machine, and to simplify how it works, you can think of it as a highway, with many many gaps. When a thought is processed by the brain, be it conscious or subconscious, a spark of electricity travels the brain, and when it reaches those gaps, it jumps them to get the information across to where it needs to go. So for example, when your boss tells you to write a report, the part of your brain that translates speech sends the information to the part of the brain that processes commands. At least, that is how it is supposed to work. With ADHD those commands don't always make it over the gaps, so while you heard, and understood what the other person was saying, you dont always remember it. This makes its hard for children to focus at school, but it makes it especially hard in the workplace.</p><p>How do you deal with this? Well, there are many ways, including medicine. Currently, I deal with it by making lists. Lots of lists. Too many lists! I currently have about 4 different lists, that I cant always check when I'm out and about. So this helps, but it isn't a real fix. Medicine certainly helps, but it comes with so many side effects, that it isn't always worth it. Another issue with medicine, is the fact that I forget to take the medicine, so any benefit I might have gotten, immediately goes out the window.</p><p>Being ADHD comes with some benefits. Most of of the people I've met with ADHD are extremely skilled in one area, including myself. For example, I am quite good with computers. Its not something I can explain, I just understand how they work. I can focus so completely, I become dead to the world. It allows me to turn a task, into an obsession. Here is the caveat. It only works on things I like... pretty useless super power huh? Its not something I can just turn on. On the contrary, for me to focus on anything else, is nothing short of a miracle. I have no long term memory, and by that, I mean anything more than 10 minutes ago, just slips out of my brain like a wisp of smoke.</p><p>Most others with ADHD are the same way. Lots of potential, with a glaring weakness. It would be funny, if it weren't so inconvenient. Sometimes, I wish instead of being good with computers, I wish I could just be focused and at least be able to take care of what needs to be taken care of.</p><p>Anyways. Long and the short of it, is that like everyone else, I'm different. Its our little quirks that make us who we are, not our sameness. When we are attracted to someone, and especially when your attracted to an opposite of you, its the things that make you different that make you so special. Without these differences, there would be no flavor in the world. It's what makes the world such a wonderful place.... And that is my 2 cents.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/when-life-steals-your-lemons-steal-them-back.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> When life steals your lemons... steal them back?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/a-phone-made-out-of-crack.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> A Phone made out of Crack? </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
