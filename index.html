Gate changes? Delays? Weather? All of this is pretty important to our lives and livelihood. Our company is kind enough to issue us apps and programs to monitor this, but none of them give you notifications. If you are curious about any of that information, you need to go back into the app and double check it. That is where FlightTrack shines! Once you enter in your flights, you are set! It calculates your layovers, your gate changes, and delays and notifies you if any of these things change. It has made my job a lot easier and the notifications are practically in real time. I have even used the app to help my passengers figure out if there are gate changes or delays if they are connecting gates. So, do I like FlightTrack? Absolutely! Is it perfect? Nope!

Well have no fear, Image Shrink Lite is here! I use Groupme a lot to communicate with my friends and family, and one of the great features is that it allows you to share full resolution photos! This is great but sometimes when you are out and about it, without wifi, it can take forever to send a photo. What I do instead, is run the photo through Image Shrink Lite and it makes the file much smaller, without losing much quality. It's a great little tool, and the Lite version is free. It supports a ton of image resolutions and if you buy the pro version, you can even batch shrink photos, so you can share them that much easier! <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/android-app-review-image-shrink-lite-resizer.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" class="feed__author">Djangelic</a> <time datetime="2013-11-27T22:32" class="feed__date">November 27, 2013</time></div><h2><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/mobile-app-review-cluster-photo-sharing-done-right.html">Mobile App Review - Cluster - Photo Sharing Done Right</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>When it comes to photo sharing, Facebook is usually the way to go. Unfortunately, not everyone is on Facebook (yeah, crazy right?). Well I have found a great app that is on both Android and iOS that helps bridge that gap. It's called cluster, and in a nutshell, it allows people to create a space to share photos for different events. A great example is going to be coming up in February, I have a skiing trip planned with a group of my close friends. Usually we would have to create a dropbox folder, and if any of my friends don't have a dropbox account they would then need to create one. Normally this isn't bad, but it is complicated, and a bit much for what we need. We just need a place to share photos as a group, and download them all in one go. This is great if you are normally the designated photographer of a group, and are never in photos because you are the one taking them! This way everyone can take photos of everyone and have them in one place! Cluster makes this quick and efficient.
