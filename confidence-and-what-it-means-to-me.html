How some people seem naturally confident in their skin, and others are not. Well, I ran into an article the other day that  really helped me understand it better. You can find the article here, and if you have a few minutes, I recommend you check it out. I have always lived my life in the moment, and that can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. It is good because I definitely come across as very confident in myself, but sometimes it is bad, because I live so much in the moment that I become oblivious of myself. Part of it is that I forget things easily, because I am so focused on what is going on at the moment, and I also don't think ahead to the future and what the consequences of my actions hold. It's something I want to work on, to help balance it out, so that I continue to live in the moment, but I also want to be aware of my past and future. Especially now that I am running my own business. It is easy to forget your other customers when you are working with your current customer, and that is something I want to avoid. I also created the facebook cover below, feel free to use it if you like it."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/confidence-and-what-it-means-to-me.html"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/feed.xml"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/feed.json"><meta property="og:title" content="Confidence, and what it means to me"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Life in the Tech Lane"><meta property="og:description" content="I have been spending a lot of time thinking about confidence, and what it means.
