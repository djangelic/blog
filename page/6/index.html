Specifically, the issue of friends. I am blessed to have many friends, from many walks of life, and he had mentioned to me how difficult it is to make friends. I took a moment to think about the many friends I have accumulated throughout my life, and realized that honestly, it's quite easy, at least below the surface it is.

What I have been finding is that my money is increasingly going to fast food. Not only is this hard on my wallet, but fast food in itself isn't very healthy for you. Instead, I will be looking for ways to save money, by making my own food! This will also help me learn to be more self sufficient,  and when the ladies ask if I can cook, well, I will be able to say yes! I took the recipe below from reddit, credit goes to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/electric_sandwich">electric_sandwich</a> on this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cidla/i_have_13_until_my_next_pay_check_in_15_weeks_so/">reddit thread</a>.

How some people seem naturally confident in their skin, and others are not. Well, I ran into an article the other day that  really helped me understand it better. <a href="http://www.tenmagnet.com/2012/09/the-real-secret-to-confidence/">You can find the article here</a>, and if you have a few minutes, I recommend you check it out. I have always lived my life in the moment, and that can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. It is good because I definitely come across as very confident in myself, but sometimes it is bad, because I live so much in the moment that I become oblivious of myself. Part of it is that I forget things easily, because I am so focused on what is going on at the moment, and I also don't think ahead to the future and what the consequences of my actions hold. It's something I want to work on, to help balance it out, so that I continue to live in the moment, but I also want to be aware of my past and future. Especially now that I am running my own business. It is easy to forget your other customers when you are working with your current customer, and that is something I want to avoid. I also created the facebook cover below, feel free to use it if you like it. <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/confidence-and-what-it-means-to-me.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></p></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" class="feed__author">Djangelic</a> <time datetime="2012-05-14T22:33" class="feed__date">May 14, 2012</time></div><h2><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/how-to-talk-to-women-one-simple-technique-which-will-prevent-you-from-blanking-out.html">How to talk to women: One simple technique which will prevent you from blanking out</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><div class="entry"><p>You walk up to a woman and say “Hey”. She smiles and says “Hi”. And then what do you do? Well you need to keep a conversation going! Because if you are not talking to her in a smooth and controlled manner, you’re probably not going to be able to get her number let alone take her home with you. Keeping a conversation alive with a woman can be difficult. My mind just used to go blank and I was never sure of what I should talk about. But after years of working on this and observing some of the best seducers talking to women, I finally understand how you can use conversation as a tool to attract women.</p><p>In this post I will show you a conversation technique which will help you keep a conversation going for as long as you want. If you can master this simple technique, you can have the confidence to approach anyone, not just beautiful women, and start talking. I will also show you how you should approach conversation with women, because after all, a woman’s thought processes are completely different from a man’s. <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/how-to-talk-to-women-one-simple-technique-which-will-prevent-you-from-blanking-out.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></p></div></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/page/7/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/page/5/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
