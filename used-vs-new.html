Lets get one thing straight first. I love video games. They are to me what sports are to others. Video games give my life the flavor it needs to keep it from becoming stale and tasteless, and I understand that without capital, video games won't be made (well the big ones anyways, there are some amazing open source gems out there like Hedge Wars, and 3d Scorch).

I do admit, I dont know how the sales model works, but if I understand it correctly, the stores buy the games from the consumer at 1/4 the sale price, and then sell it back at huge profits, and the devs make nothing off that deal. I am ready for games to go straight digital so not only does this not happen as often, but hopefully the devs will price point this where 'during these troubled times' most people can afford the game."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/used-vs-new.html"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/feed.xml"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/feed.json"><meta property="og:title" content="Used Vs.

The discussion centers around the premise that buying a new game is "better" than buying a used game from a place like gamestop, since the new game directly compensates the developer, whereas a used game just gives a place like gamestop the profits. Lets get one thing straight first. I love video games. They are to me what sports are to others.

I do admit, I dont know how the sales model works, but if I understand it correctly, the stores buy the games from the consumer at 1/4 the sale price, and then sell it back at huge profits, and the devs make nothing off that deal. I am ready for games to go straight digital so not only does this not happen as often, but hopefully the devs will price point this where "during these troubled times" most people can afford the game. I find myself more and more buying games from steam, and not only is it more convenient than buying the physical media, but it is usually cheaper. My only concern is console games, and even this is being alleviated by online stores by Microsoft and Sony who see that this is the future. So to finish this up, while I support the devs, people like my little brother who don't have a job (he just graduated high school) need to be able to buy games at a fairly decent price point, and he isnt a computer gamer, so the games he likes, probably are not available digitally. That is my 2 cents.</p><p><a title="Attribution License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/cc.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/responsive/cc-xs.png 300w, https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/responsive/cc-sm.png 480w, https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/responsive/cc-md.png 768w, https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/responsive/cc-lg.png 1024w, https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/responsive/cc-xl.png 1360w, https://djangelic.github.io/blog/media/posts/187/responsive/cc-2xl.png 1600w" border="0" alt="Creative Commons License" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle"></a><a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="DaveFayram" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9511824@N05/3757539358/" target="_blank">DaveFayram</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/nerdcore-suprising.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Nerdcore, Suprising!</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/google-voice-and-gmail-team-up.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Google Voice and Gmail Team Up </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
