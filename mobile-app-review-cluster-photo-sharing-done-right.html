Read on for more!</p><p>This is a great tool for:</p><p>Brides/Grooms – Have your DJ announce or post your album code if there is a projector Friends – easily gather photos from everyone in your group after a fun night out. Parents – collect photos of your children and share memories with family everywhere. Travelers – create an album of your trip and collect photos from travel friends. Events - I went through flight attendant training, and this would have been great to get everyone's photos together</p><p>The process could not be simpler! Install the app and create an account (or if you have facebook use the Facebook login button). After you have your account created, simply create a new cluster and add photos from your phone, or take someones Album Code and join their cluster. From there just add photos and you are good to go. I have to say, it could not be easier to use, and I plan on using it a lot!</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cluster-group-photo-albums/id596595032?mt=8" target="_blank">Iphone iOS Store</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getcluster.android&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Android Play Store</a></p><p>[gallery link="file" ids="1386,1387,1388,1389,1390"]</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/25-killer-websites-that-make-you-cleverer.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 25 Killer Websites that Make You Cleverer</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/android-app-review-image-shrink-lite-resizer.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Android App Review - Image Shrink Lite (Resizer) </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-13T17:11" class="feed__date">November 13, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-the-last-airbender.html">Movie Review - The last Airbender</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-12T16:48" class="feed__date">November 12, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-jonah-hex.html">Movie Review - Jonah Hex</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-04T19:57" class="feed__date">November 4, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/kik-messenger-review-chat-like-its-1999.html">Kik Messenger Review - Chat like its 1999...</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
