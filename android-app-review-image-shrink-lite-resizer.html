Well have no fear, Image Shrink Lite is here! I use Groupme a lot to communicate with my friends and family, and one of the great features is that it allows you to share full resolution photos! This is great but sometimes when you are out and about it, without wifi, it can take forever to send a photo. What I do instead, is run the photo through Image Shrink Lite and it makes the file much smaller, without losing much quality. It's a great little tool, and the Lite version is free. It supports a ton of image resolutions and if you buy the pro version, you can even batch shrink photos, so you can share them that much easier!"><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/android-app-review-image-shrink-lite-resizer.html"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/feed.xml"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/feed.json"><meta property="og:title" content="Android App Review - Image Shrink Lite (Resizer)"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Life in the Tech Lane"><meta property="og:description" content="Ever wanted to share photos with someone on your phone, but your phone network took forever to upload it?
