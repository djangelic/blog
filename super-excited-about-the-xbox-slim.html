This would solve so many problems!! But I'm sure that there are many other hurdles that I'm not considering. Like the fact that not all people get their tv from cable. some people get their tv from satellite, or other sources.</p><p>So Engadget has released more information on the new Droid X, and I have to say that I'm pretty sad that it doesn't have a front facing camera. Not that I would actually go with Verizon, but T-mobile doesnt really have any options right now... Not sure if I'm gonna jump the gun, or wait till march till my wife's contract ends... I much prefer the Sprint Evo...</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/antabuse-use.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> antabuse use</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/alternative-use-for-google-voice.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Alternative use for Google Voice! </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2011-06-11T21:03" class="feed__date">June 11, 2011</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-super-8.html">Movie Review - Super 8</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-08-12T11:04" class="feed__date">August 12, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/super-ego-and-ego-what-the-id.html">Super-ego and Ego?
