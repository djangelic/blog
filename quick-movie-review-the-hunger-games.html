I am a pretty big fan of post apocalyptic books, especially lately. Well, I actually just found out about the movie not too long ago, maybe a month or two, and was pretty excited! The movie more than lived up to my expectations. The effects were well done, the characters were perfectly cast (imho), and the dialogue was spot on. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It is not a kids movie of course, if the PG-13 didn't clue you in, but it is quite violent, as the premise is based around a violent fight to the death by kids, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, it was a great movie, and I recommend it thoroughly!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/authors/djangelic/" rel="author">Djangelic</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/the-no-fast-food-for-a-month-challenge.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The &quot;No Fast Food For A Month&quot; Challenge...</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/how-to-spot-a-phishing-job-offer-email.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How to spot a phishing job offer email </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-13T17:11" class="feed__date">November 13, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-the-last-airbender.html">Movie Review - The last Airbender</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-12T16:48" class="feed__date">November 12, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/movie-review-jonah-hex.html">Movie Review - Jonah Hex</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2010-11-04T19:57" class="feed__date">November 4, 2010</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/kik-messenger-review-chat-like-its-1999.html">Kik Messenger Review - Chat like its 1999...</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://djangelic.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
